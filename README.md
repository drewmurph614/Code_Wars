Data Science Portfolio by Drew Murphy

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis, running machine learning algorithms, and exploring a wide range of data science topics. The portfolio was created primarily to support the efforts of the Haiti Now organization, but also includes personal projects utilizing data from Kaggle.com.
